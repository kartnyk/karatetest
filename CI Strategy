Karate CI/CD Setup for Scheduled Test Execution

Objective

To configure the integration-tests-karate GitLab repository to run Karate integration tests on a scheduled basis only, such as nightly runs, using GitLab CI/CD.


---

Final .gitlab-ci.yml for Scheduled Karate Test Runs

karate-tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running Karate tests on schedule..."
    - mvn clean test -Dkarate.env=$ENVIRONMENT
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule"'
      when: always
    - when: never
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths:
      - target/karate-reports
    expire_in: 7 days

Explanation:

rules: ensure that the job only runs if the pipeline is started by a GitLab schedule.

when: never prevents execution for any other pipeline source like push, merge, or trigger.

artifacts: preserve the Karate test reports for download or review later.

How to Create a Scheduled Pipeline in GitLab

1. Go to the GitLab Project: Navigate to the integration-tests-karate project in your GitLab instance.


2. Open Schedules: In the left sidebar, go to: CI/CD > Schedules


3. Click “New schedule”:

Description: Nightly Karate Tests

Interval pattern: 0 1 * * * (every day at 1:00 AM UTC)

Target branch: main (or the branch to run tests from)

Timezone: Select your preferred timezone



4. Set Pipeline Variables: Add a new variable:

Key: ENVIRONMENT

Value: qa (or any target environment like dev, staging)



5. Save the Schedule: GitLab will now automatically trigger the pipeline at the scheduled time, and it will run only the karate-tests job.

Benefits

No manual triggers or push events needed.

Keeps your integration tests isolated and automated.

Ensures clean resource usage, as no unnecessary pipelines will be run.


This setup is ideal for maintaining a nightly or weekly regression suite using Karate, fully managed by GitLab CI/CD schedules.
